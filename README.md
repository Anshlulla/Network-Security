## Overview

This project provides an automated workflow for:
- Scanning networks to collect data.
- Processing and classifying the data with a binary classification model.
- Deploying the application in a scalable and reproducible manner using Docker and AWS services.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Ingestion

The ingestion module collects raw network data from various sources. It is responsible for securely gathering and storing this data for further processing. Data sources may include network logs, packet captures, or real-time network events.

### 2. Validation

In this stage, the ingested data is checked for integrity, completeness, and correctness. Invalid or corrupt records are flagged or removed, ensuring high-quality input for the next steps.

### 3. Transformation

Data transformation involves cleaning, normalizing, and feature engineering. This step converts raw network data into a structured format suitable for binary classification, extracting meaningful features and encoding categorical variables as needed.

### 4. Model Trainer

The model trainer module uses the processed data to train a binary classification model. This may involve selecting appropriate algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating model performance using standard metrics.

### 5. Prediction

The prediction component takes new, unseen network data and applies the trained model to classify events or connections as benign or malicious. Results are output for further action or reporting.

### 6. CI/CD & Deployment

- The pipeline is containerized using Docker, ensuring a consistent runtime environment.
- CI/CD workflows build the Docker image and push it to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
- The application is then deployed to an AWS EC2 instance, enabling scalable and reliable production serving.

## Installation & Usage
